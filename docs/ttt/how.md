# How does it work?

TODO:

- Unicode history
    - Basic blocks, up and down (resolution: 2 ppc)
    - Braille (8 ppc, ugly)
    - Symbols for legacy computing (6 ppc, stretched)
    - Bleeding edge: Symbols for legacy computing supplement (8 ppc)
        - Not straight forward to use, unicode doesn't want to repeat itself so lots are missing
- Encoding an image into a number
    - LUT
